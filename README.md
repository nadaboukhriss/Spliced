In the land of Celestial Shore, Aelia, a human fighter, and Ash, a fox spirit, accidentally merge into one body during a heated argument over the Amulet of Souls, a powerful artifact that controls souls and prevents chaos in their world. When Aelia and Ash merged into one body, the Amulet of Souls shattered into pieces scattered throughout Celestial Shore, and hidden within perilous dungeons. To restore the Amulet of Souls and regain their individual forms, Aelia and Ash must learn to trust each other and work together to overcome challenges that test their abilities and their bond. 

Can Aelia and Ash successfully retrieve all the fragments of the amulet and separate from each other before it's too late? Or will they remain forever fused as one being?
